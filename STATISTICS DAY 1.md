  1. What is Statistics and what are the its Types?<br>
--> Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing of the data.(for Better Decision Making).</p>

<p>

# TYPES OF STATISTICS:

<p>
  i. Descriptive Statistics<br>
--> It consists of organizing and summarizing data.<br>

ii. Inferential Statistics<br>
--> Technique where in we used the data that we have measures to form conclusion.
<br>
</p>  
Example:<br>
  
Classroom of Maths Student Marks obtain in First Semester.<br>
(84, 86, 78, 72, 75, 65, 80, 81, 92, 95, 96, 97)

<p>
What type of question comes in Descriptive Statistics.<br>
What is the average marks of the student in the class?<br>

What type of question comes in Inferential Statistics.<br>
Are the marks of the students of this classroom similar to the marks of the Maths Classroom in the college?<br>
