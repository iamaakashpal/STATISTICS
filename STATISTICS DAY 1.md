<p>
  1. What is Statistics and what are the its Types?<br>
--> Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing and analyzing of the data.(for Better Decision Making).</p>

<p>
  Data :- Facts or pieces of information that can be measured.<br>
Eg. Height of the Student(150cm, 155cm, 180cm).
</p>

# TYPES OF STATISTICS:

![Type of Statistics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95436738/186883336-40aa51bb-1bc3-4663-919d-c60bcd8cc862.png)

<br>
<p>
  i. Descriptive Statistics<br>
--> It consists of organizing and summarizing data.<br>

ii. Inferential Statistics<br>
--> Technique where in we used the data that we have measures to form conclusion.
<br>
</p>  
Example:<br>
  
Classroom of Maths Student Marks obtain in First Semester.<br>
(84, 86, 78, 72, 75, 65, 80, 81, 92, 95, 96, 97)

<p>
★ What type of question comes in Descriptive Statistics.<br>
What is the average marks of the student in the class?<br>

★ What type of question comes in Inferential Statistics.<br>
Are the marks of the students of this classroom similar to the marks of the Maths Classroom in the college?<br>
</p>

# POPULATION AND SAMPLE

Population denotes as (N) whereas Sample denotes as (n).
<br><br>

![2 Population and Sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95436738/186890973-538bb25b-ab99-4ffa-bcc3-96e9babcdea5.png)


# SAMPLING TECHNIQUES

![3 Sampling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95436738/186895452-24944fca-60e0-4129-80f7-b6d1e6a8558f.png)

<p>
  i. Simple Random Sampling:<br>
--> Every member of the Population(N) has an equal chance of being selected for your Sample(n).
</p>
<p>
 ii. Stratified Sampling<br>
--> Where the Populaton(N) is split into Non-Overlapping Group(Strata)
<br>
Eg. Gender(Male/Female), Age Bins(0-10,11-20,21-30), Blood Group(0,A,B,AB) etc
</p>
<p>
iii. Systematic Sampling<br>
--> Catch every 5th person
</p>
<p>
iv. Convenience Sampling<br>
--> Only those people are interested.
</p>

# VARIABLE

<p>
--> A Variable is a property that can take on any value.<br>
Eg.Height = 157cm
Weight = 77kg
</p>

# TYPES OF VARIABLE

![4 Types of Variable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95436738/186898815-0785c982-5910-4795-bc4e-a33e436c0223.png)


<p>
  i. Quantitative Variable.<br>
--> Measured Numerically(+,-,*,/)<br>
Eg. Age, Height, Weight.
</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;a. Discrete Variable<br>
&emsp;&emsp;--> Whole Number <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Eg. Number of Bank Account, Number of Family Member.
</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp;b. Continuos Variable<br>
&emsp;&emsp;--> Decimal Number<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Eg. Height of a Person, Rainfall Measurement
</p>

<p>
ii. Qualitative / Categoriacal Variable.<br>
--> Gender(Male/Female) (Based on some characteristic we can derive categorial variable.)
</p>
